                    <h4>Grab Baggage in Grabbage!</h4>

                    <p> University project that was completed over the course of one semester.</p>

                    <p>A fast-paced, colourful game about retrieving your luggage from the airport. Using non-standard game mechanics and an unusual environment, Grabbage is a unique small experimental game that rewards speedy grabs and a quick eye. Find your bag then keep an eye on it as you manipulate the conveyor belts to grab it as fast as possible.</p>




                    <p>The project aimed to demonstrate four  main personal strengths. These were:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Originality in game design</li>

                        <li>Grasp of scope and ability to envision what can be produced in a certain time frame</li>

                        <li>Project management – achieving this vision</li>

                        <li>  Adaptability and quick learning</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The game was created using UE4, Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator and Substance Painter.</p>

                    <hr />

                    <h2>Dev Diary</h2>
                    <strong>Week 0: Concept</strong>
                    <p>From a theme of reclaimed, Grabbage grew as an idea that was not exactly a unique interpretation of the word, but still carried with it an unusual and mundane setting for a video game. Use of the mundane in art and video games has produced many wonderful, inspiring works. In fact, with the airport setting it is hard not to mention Papers, Please as being a key inspiration.</p>

                    <strong>Week 1: Planning and Pre-production</strong>

                    <div class="imagerow">
                        <img src="scenedraft1.jpg" />
                        <img src="scenedraft3.jpg" />
                    </div>

                    <p>Grabbage is designed to be a low risk project, with an almost guaranteed result at the end. However, I find low risk doesn’t have to avoid the unknown. Before even the plan was completed, uncertain elements were experimented with and tested. Anything that I was unsure I could produce was drafted very quickly before being integrated into the plan. However, to minimise risk, physics-based movement for the bags has been ruled out and they will follow a nice, predictable set path. The game will be playable from around week 3 / 4, with everything after that being extra features and polish.</p>

                    <strong>Week 2: Fun with blueprints</strong>
                    <div class="imagerow"><img src="Capture1.jpg" /></div>
                    <p>All the basic groundwork is completed. The scene for the game was drafted using basic geometric shapes and using blueprints a functioning conveyor belt and player movement was integrated. Bags have randomly generated properties and are spaced according to their position in the queue. Currently, new bags are manually spawned in.</p>

                    <strong>Week 3: Basic Bag Interaction</strong>
                    <p>Bags have been switched over to automatic spawning, and can be grabbed by the player. The exact bag required is generated and shown in scene as a placeholder for its HUD implementation.</p>

                    <strong>Week 4: Minimum Viable Product</strong>
                    <p>Character generation is established but as there are no models, the results are not visible. The conveyor belt controls have been added to the game, so bags can be swapped between belts. New bags will now spawn between rounds into empty spaces, so the game is now fully playable and loops indefinitely.</p>

                    <strong>Week 5: 3D Work Begins</strong>
                    <p> Scene object modelling is completed and these models are textured. The character models have a first pass done and the random generation is now clear.</p>

                    <strong>Week 6: 2D Work Begins</strong>
                    <p>
                        The focus of the 2D elements is the bag request visual. It is vital for the gameplay so must  be clear and resemble the bags on the belts. It should also be obvious to the player that this is the goal. This was planned to be emphasised with a 2D animation showing the bag emerging as a thought bubble from each character. However, masking and lighting the request bag graphic to resemble the other bags as close as possible was prioritised.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Basic scoring is implemented and now displayed on screen. The scene layout has been revised somewhat so that the character moves from the left hand screen to the right, as this should feel more natural for most players.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Week 7: Trouble in Bag Paradise</strong>
                    <div class="imagerow"><img src="bags1.jpg" /></div>
                    <p>The first iteration of bag models was completed but found to be lacking. In the scene, the bags are small and the finer details are lost. As the appearance of the bag models directly affects the game, it is essential that extra time is taken to revise these models so that they are more distinct at small sizes.</p>

                    <strong>Week 8: New bags. New character. New materials</strong>
                    <div class="imagerow">
                        <img src="bags2.jpg" />
                        <img src="faces.jpg" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="imagerow">
                        <img src="fullbag1.jpg" />
                        <img src="fullbag2.jpg" />
                    </div>
                    <p>This week sees many model revisions. There are new bags, a new character and much progress on the textures and materials.</p>

                    <strong>Week 9: Bag Colours Finalised</strong>
                    <div class="imagerow">
                        <img src="bagcolours.jpg" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Finalising the bag colours took a lot of experimentation. Black or dark shades are out because they blend in too much with the dark conveyor belt, so the colours must be bright, distinct, and not be too much of an eyesore when combined at random in the scene. The final result isn’t perfect, but it just about works.</p>

                    <strong>Week 10: Menus Complete</strong>
                    <p>The menus are all finalised and integrated. There hasn’t been as much time as I’d like to spend on the design of the menus and there are many disparate elements that make them not really fit together as a cohesive whole. Two new faces have been added to the character pool to give them further variety and enforce the narrative of the game, where ‘your character’ is many different people.</p>

                    </div>

                    <strong>Week 11: Enter the Tutorial</strong>
                    <p>Featuring an all new tutorial system, Grabbage can now guide you through the Controls and concept step by step. All that remains is to thoroughly test things are working as intended and patch up any small problems.</p>
